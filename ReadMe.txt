This repository relates to my thesis in phD of computer engineering. Subject of my thesis is "A model for subgraph mining in big graphs".
The solutions in this repository are going to be expanded to include all topics in the domain of sub-graph mining
such as
	1- Clustering coefficient
	2- Community detection
	3- Subgraph search
	...

To process big graph, most of the active frameworks in big data processing are investigated and currently among them Spark and Redis have been chosen.

Now the following problem have been solved by this framework:
	1- Triangle Counting
	2- Triangle Listing
	3- Global clustering coefficient
	4- Local clustering coefficient
	5- Ktruss detection
